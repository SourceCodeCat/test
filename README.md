# test
There are two versions of  the code:

1. With only  1 'if' clause, **which is what was requested**
   That version of the code is tagged as "**without_if_clause**"  which is also at the HEAD

2. Without any  'if' clause, as the name depicts no IF was used whatsoever,
   That version of the code can be downloaded or looked with the following tag: "**with_one_if_clause**"
   also it can be seen in the release tab. This was not requested but actually was the first version of the code
